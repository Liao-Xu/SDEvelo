# SDEvelo: a deep generative approach for transcriptional dynamics with cell-specific latent time and multivariate stochastic modeling

## Overview

SDEvelo leverages advanced stochastic differential equations (SDE) to provide a novel approach to RNA velocity analysis in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). This deep generative model accurately captures the complex, stochastic nature of transcriptional dynamics, offering new insights into cell differentiation and state transitions.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.6 or later installed. SDEvelo can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install sdevelo
