# Multivariate stochastic modeling for transcriptional dynamics with cell-specific latent time using SDEvelo

## Overview

SDEvelo represents a significant advancement in the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, offering a novel approach to inferring RNA velocity through multivariate stochastic differential equations (SDE). This generative model accurately captures the complex, stochastic nature of transcriptional dynamics, providing new insights into cell differentiation and state transitions.

## Installation Guide

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed on your system.
2. Install SDEvelo via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install sdevelo
   ```

SDEvelo is available on PyPI: [https://pypi.org/project/sdevelo/](https://pypi.org/project/sdevelo/)

This image showcases the various downstream tasks and analyses that can be performed using the results from SDEvelo.

### Key Features

- **Multivariate stochastic modeling**: Captures complex, stochastic transcriptional dynamics across multiple genes simultaneously.
- **Cell-specific latent time estimation**: Provides accurate representation of cellular progression through biological processes.
- **Versatile applicability**: Suitable for both scRNA-seq and sequencing-based spatial transcriptomics data.
- **Computational efficiency**: Designed to be scalable for large datasets.
- **Carcinogenesis detection**: Demonstrates high accuracy in identifying cancerous processes.
- **Facilitation of downstream analyses**: Enables a wide range of biological discoveries through comprehensive output.

### Addressing Limitations in Existing Methods

SDEvelo addresses limitations of traditional RNA velocity analysis methods that rely on ordinary differential equations (ODE) to model individual genes sequentially. By using multivariate SDEs, explicitly modeling uncertainty, and estimating cell-specific latent time across genes, SDEvelo offers a more accurate and comprehensive approach to understanding cell differentiation and state transitions in scRNA-seq studies.
