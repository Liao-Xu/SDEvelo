# Simulation Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates the application of SDEvelo to simulated data.

## Contents

In this tutorial, we will:

1. Generate simulated single-cell RNA sequencing data
2. Apply SDEvelo to model the transcriptional dynamics
3. Analyze the results and compare them to the ground truth
