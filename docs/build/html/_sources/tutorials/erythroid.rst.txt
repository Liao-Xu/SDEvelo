Erythroid Differentiation Tutorial
=================================

This tutorial focuses on applying SDEvelo to study erythroid differentiation.

Contents
--------

In this tutorial, we will:

1. Load and preprocess single-cell RNA sequencing data from erythroid differentiation
2. Apply SDEvelo to model the transcriptional dynamics during erythropoiesis
3. Analyze cell trajectories and identify key stages of erythroid differentiation
4. Explore the gene expression changes associated with erythroid maturation
