# HCC Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates the application of SDEvelo to Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) data. HCC is the most common type of primary liver cancer in adults, and understanding its progression at the single-cell level can provide valuable insights into cancer development and potential therapeutic targets.

## Contents

In this tutorial, we will:

1. Load and preprocess HCC single-cell RNA sequencing data
2. Apply SDEvelo to model transcriptional dynamics in HCC cells
3. Analyze cell trajectories and gene expression patterns
4. Identify key genes and processes involved in HCC progression

## Notebooks

This tutorial is split into two parts:

   :maxdepth: 1

   demo_HCC1
   demo_HCC2

The first notebook (`demo_HCC1`) focuses on data preprocessing and initial SDEvelo application, while the second notebook (`demo_HCC2`) delves deeper into the analysis and biological interpretation of the results.

Follow along with these notebooks to gain insights into how SDEvelo can be used to study complex diseases like HCC at the single-cell level.
