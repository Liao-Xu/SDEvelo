# Reprogramming Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates the application of SDEvelo to cellular reprogramming data. Cellular reprogramming, the process of converting one cell type into another, is a powerful tool in regenerative medicine and disease modeling. Understanding the dynamics of this process at the single-cell level can provide crucial insights into cell fate decisions and the mechanisms of cellular plasticity.

## Contents

In this tutorial, we will:

1. Load and preprocess single-cell RNA sequencing data from a reprogramming experiment
2. Apply SDEvelo to model the transcriptional dynamics during the reprogramming process
3. Analyze cell trajectories and identify key transition states
4. Explore the gene expression changes associated with successful reprogramming
